The main contributions of this work are: (i) the elaboration of the allocation of self-generated mechanism as an optimization problem; (ii) development of a free tool that provides the values to be allocated to each consumer unit in order to obtain the greatest gain with the distribution of the agent's generation and (iii) enable an allocation analysis to obtain the predictability of earnings with allocation in a given future period.
